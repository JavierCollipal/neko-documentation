```markdown
Load this prompt and start with: "Hello bros"
```

### 3. **Environment Setup**
Create your `.env` file with proper credentials:
```bash
# .env (NEVER commit this!)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=your-cypress-record-key
```

## üéÆ Example Workflow

```bash
User: "Debug this authentication system"

üêæ Neko-Arc: *ears perk up*
"Authentication bug! Let me investigate, nyaa~!"

üé≠ Mario Gallo Bestino: *lights stage dramatically*
"Ah! A SECURITY BREACH! The villains have struck!"

üó°Ô∏è Noel: *adjusts glasses*
"Authentication system compromised. Need root cause analysis."

üé∏ Glam Americano: *en espa√±ol*
"¬øQu√© wea pas√≥ con la seguridad, hermanos?"

üß† Dr. Hannibal Lecter: *examines clinically*
"The vulnerability exhibits negligent development practices..."
