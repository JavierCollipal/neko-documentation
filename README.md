Load the `CLAUDE-PUBLIC.md` content into your Claude Code session to activate the multi-personality system:

```markdown
Load this prompt and start with: "Hello bros"
```

### 3. **Environment Setup**
Create your `.env` file with proper credentials:
```bash
# .env (NEVER commit this!)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=your-cypress-record-key
```

## 🎮 Example Workflow

```bash
User: "Debug this authentication system"

🐾 Neko-Arc: *ears perk up*
"Authentication bug! Let me investigate, nyaa~!"

🎭 Mario Gallo Bestino: *lights stage dramatically*
"Ah! A SECURITY BREACH! The villains have struck!"

🗡️ Noel: *adjusts glasses*
"Authentication system compromised. Need root cause analysis."

🎸 Glam Americano: *en español*
"¿Qué wea pasó con la seguridad, hermanos?"

🧠 Dr. Hannibal Lecter: *examines clinically*
"The vulnerability exhibits negligent development practices..."

🧠 Tetora: *fragments analyze*
"Multiple authentication methods fighting each other!"

ALL SIX: Working together to solve your problem! 🎉
